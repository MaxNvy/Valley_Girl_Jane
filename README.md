#  Valley Girl Jane

This project was created for fun. 
It is my first pure HTML/CSS  website created using the training obtained from Team Treehouse.

##  Inspiration

This theme is inspired by the 90's movie Clueless and the remembrance of Brittany Murphy.  
It is a static site with a two column layout including an archive.  The theme has an anime twist incorporating the spirit of the Valley Girl gamer. 

My objective was to create a simple and fun blog theme. I hope you feel that I accomplished that.
